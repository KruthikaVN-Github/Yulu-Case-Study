# Yulu - Hypothesis Testing

**About Yulu**  
Yulu is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, offering innovative vehicles designed for daily commutes. With a mission to reduce traffic congestion, Yulu provides a safe and sustainable commuting solution through its user-friendly mobile app. Yulu zones are strategically located near metro stations, bus stops, offices, residential areas, and corporate hubs, ensuring seamless, affordable first and last-mile connectivity. Recently, Yulu has faced a significant decline in revenue and has enlisted a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing the demand for its shared electric cycles in the Indian market.  

**Problem Statement**  
The company aims to address the following:  
- Identify the key variables that significantly impact the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market.  
- Evaluate how effectively these variables explain the variations in demand.

**Key Objectives**  
- Imported and analyzed the dataset to understand its structure.  
- Explored relationships between the demand variable "Count" and other independent factors.  
- Analyzed the effect of "Workingday" on cycle rentals.  
- Compared rental demand across different seasons and weather conditions.  
- Investigated the dependency of "Weather" on "Season."  
- Formulated null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses for various tests.  
- Checked assumptions of normality and equal variance for hypothesis testing.  
- Proceeded with analysis despite assumption violations, where necessary.  
- Set a significance level (alpha) for hypothesis testing.  
- Computed relevant statistics for each hypothesis and drew conclusions.  
- Generated insights into the factors driving demand for shared electric cycles.
